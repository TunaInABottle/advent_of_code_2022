# Advent of Code 2022
I want to learn a new programming language so I decided to take on the "Advent of Code" challenge of this year with a new programming language: Julia

You can find more on https://adventofcode.com

# Structure
Each folder is a day, e.g. "01" is day 1 where a "main.js" and the dataset(s) for the day are contained. "utils.jl" contains a set of utility functions that seems that are not be available natively in Julia yet. "new_day.sh" is a bash script that prepares the folder for the day.

# Execution
After installing Julia, open a folder for the day and execute "julia main.jl" . from day 5 it is also necessary to specify the data source ("example" or "data")
